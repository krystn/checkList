## Getting Started

### **Adding a todo item**

> Enter new todo item in the text input and click `Add`

> The text input can't be empty, otherwise an alert will pop up prompting the user to write something

> When a valid todo item is submitted, it will show up under 'To-do' and will count how many items the user has left

### **Completing a todo item**

> By clicking the checkbox, the todo item gets moved to the 'Completed' section and will count how many completed items the user has

> Completing a todo item will also update the 'To-do' count

> The user can uncheck the checkbox to bring the todo item back to the 'To-do' section and the counts for both 'To-do' and 'Completed' items will be updated

### **Deleting a todo item**

> A todo item in 'To-do' and 'Completed' may be deleted after clicking the red `x`

> Deleted todo items cannot be retreived
